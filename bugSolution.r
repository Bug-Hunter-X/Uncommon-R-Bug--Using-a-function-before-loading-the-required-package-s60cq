```r
# Correctly loading the package containing the function solves the error.

# Install the package if you don't have it already (only run once):
# install.packages("somePackage")

# Load the package:
library(somePackage) # Replace "somePackage" with the actual package name

data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
result <- mean(data, trim = 0.2) 
result2 <- some_fancy_function(data) # Now this will work!
